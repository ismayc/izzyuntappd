```{r setup, include=FALSE}
pkg <- c("dplyr", "ggplot2", 
  "knitr", "rmarkdown", "devtools", "DT")

new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages())]

if(length(new.pkg))
  install.packages(new.pkg, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")

if(!require(izzyuntappd))
  devtools::install_github("ismayc/untappd", force = TRUE)

lapply(pkg, library, character.only = TRUE)
options(width = 95, dplyr.print_max = 1e9)
```

We begin by loading in the dataset from this package.

```{r load_data}
data(untappd, package = "izzyuntappd")
# I've also included the dataset as a CSV file and you can read it in by using
# untappd <- read.csv(file = "chester_beer_feb15-may16.csv", header = TRUE,
#     stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Next we can look at the first few rows of this dataset:

```{r glance}
head(untappd)
```

We can determine what the mean and median `abv` values are from this data set:

```{r central_tends}
untappd %>% summarize(mean_abv = mean(abv), median_abv = median(abv))
```

We can also create a plot of this distribution of `abv`:

```{r abv_plot}
qplot(x = abv, data = untappd, geom = "histogram", bins = 20, color = I("white"))
```

If we'd like to see the top number of `style` of beer I've tried, sorted:

```{r n_styles}
style_count <- untappd %>% group_by(style) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
datatable(style_count)
```

The `datatable` function provides a nice interface for searching and sorting datasets.

You can now get a sense for which styles of beer I prefer.  Think about how you could determine which style of beer I rated highest.  Play around with the data more to see which kinds of correlations and things stand out to you!
